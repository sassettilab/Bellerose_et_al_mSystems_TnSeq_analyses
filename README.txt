Data Processing Pipelines for analysis of TnSeq libraries, published in "Distinct bacterial pathways influence the efficacy of antibiotics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis" by Bellerose et al. 

TnSeq_insertion_counts_v6 and TnSeq_insertion_counts_v7: 
	Data processing pipelines for counting TnSeq insertions
	v6 requires read lengths ≥100 bases
	v7 requires read lengths ≥75 bases
	
Resampling_Statistics: 
	For evaluating conditional fitness (Treatment vs. Control)
	
Projection_Resampling: 
	For projecting insertion counts from TnSeq across multiple samples onto principle components determined by PCA or varimax dimensions
